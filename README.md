It is challenging to do Visualization of Large Data (>30 Gb) REMOTELY (e.g. on a super cluster), isn't it? Now, we let bash + python +visit interact each other and let them do everything in background, even remotely by SSH. You just need to grab a coffee and wait (1-2 minutes) to see beautiful images and movies (need to use ffmpeg to make movie, a single line is enough.)

The above scripts are used to visualize ViSit data. A little bit of shell and python is enough for you to digest them...
